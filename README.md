# UniTrade – A Campus Marketplace App

UniTrade is a mobile application built to solve everyday problems faced by
college students when buying, selling, donating items, or dealing with lost
and found belongings inside a campus.

Students often rely on unsafe or unorganized platforms for these needs.
UniTrade provides a **secure, campus-focused solution** that keeps everything
simple, local, and trustworthy.
